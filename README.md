# Freelancer-And-Commissioner-Project
This project involved freelancers and commissioners where the commissioners would commission the freelancers to perform jobs that those freelancers advertise that they can do. The project involved multiple GUI's, using tkinter, where freelancers could make jobs so that commissioners could commission them so that those freelancers could develop their skill and earn points in the system and unlock achievements.

The goal was for a win-win between both parties as the freelancer could develop their skills in the field that they are advertising they can do and commissioners win as they get commissioned work. Freelancers were able to pick and choose what commission work they wanted to do and what they didn't want to do.

This project heavily involved me to problem solve in thinking how orders would be handled, how challenges would be handled as well as how the point system and the achievement system would work. These challenges helped me to develop and deepen my skill with python, SQL, databases and planning.
